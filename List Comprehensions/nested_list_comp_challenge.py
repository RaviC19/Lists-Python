# Using list comprehension, create a variable called answer with the following value:
# [[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]]

answer = [[num for num in range(0, 10)] for val in range(0, 10)]
print(answer)
